## Things to Do

### Water Activities
- **Kayaking in the Fajardo Bioluminescent Lagoon**  
  Highly recommended — and you *should* “fall” off the kayak and swim in the glowing water!
- **Snorkeling at La Ocho (Balneario Escambrón)**  
  The best beach for snorkeling in the San Juan metro area.

###  Around San Juan
- **Walk in Old San Juan**
- **Visit El Morro**  
  And if you have extra time, **San Cristobal Fort**.
- **Jogging Route**  
  Condado Beach (hotel area) to El Morro — about **5 miles round-trip**.

### Nature & Adventure
- **Hike in El Yunque**  
  The only rainforest in the U.S. You must drive or join a tour.
- **Zipline in Toro Negro (Toroverde)**
- **Cavernas de Camuy**  
  Massive underground cave system in Arecibo.
- **Charco Azul** (water hole)  
  Near Guavate.  
  For a more advanced option: **Tres Chorros**.

## Beaches & Coastal Spots

### Aguadilla (≈1.5 hours from San Juan)
- **Crash Boat Beach** – a very cool, vibrant beach.

### Rincón (≈2 hours from San Juan)
- Best surfing town in Puerto Rico.
- Great snorkeling; **Steps Beach** is excellent.
- **Desecheo Island Snorkeling**  
  The best snorkeling I've ever done in Puerto Rico — a deserted island 30 minutes by boat.  
  *Taino Divers* offers trips.

### Island Getaways
- **Culebra**  
  Small island with crystal-clear waters. Reachable by small plane or ferry.  
  **Flamenco Beach** is consistently ranked among the top beaches in the world.
- **Vieques**  
  Similar to Culebra but larger; also known for stunning beaches and wild horses.

### Southwest Coast (Cabo Rojo & Guánica)
Beaches and dry forest areas — less populated and packed with great beaches near each other:
- **Boquerón**
- **Ballenas**
- **Gilligan's Island**
- **Combate**
- **Balneario de Cabo Rojo**

Nearby:
- **Joyuda** – famous strip with many seafood restaurants.
